      <h4><strong>Principles that these cards currently use:</strong> </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="rules">
      - Cards are divided by keyframe sections - Dividing by keyframe doesn't look at how <i>Well</i> you did it, just how much motion you chose to have in your piece. 
      <br>- Keyframe sections must consist of at least 2 keys and one inbetween
      <br>- If a piece only has 2 keys and no inbetweens, or doesn't animate a full body section (ie, a blinking that only redraws the eyes) it gets a regular art card with "small animated flair"
      <br>- If a piece has "combined-transform" frames, they cannot count towards being inbetweens (pieces must be at least broken apart)
      <br>- If a piece reverses the action to form a loop, it can't count as a new section unless there is something obviously different going on
      <br>- "Animation principles" is a vague bonus right now, but based on Dips' idea of maybe combining some of the proposed things into a single bonus
      <br>- "3 or more hand-drawn" bonus does NOT count the keys in that section, only the frames between it. If there are more than 3 inbetweens that are handdrawn this applies on top of the traditional bonus - it helps to balance traditional if a player is uncertain about their keyframe sections; if they break it down into super small chunks this won't apply - but if they break it into bigger chunks then this helps keep the balance so that a single piece won't be drastically different in points based on how the keyframe sections are defined.

      <h4><i>Additionally:</i></h4> 
      Keep in mind that MP cards being large doesn't have to mean exponential work for mods.<br> 
      <br>
      <strong>Each piece has "sub-cards" within - we can ask players to submit each sub-card as its own card if we think it would be better for mod health/ease.</strong>
